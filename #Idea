# Improvement Ideas

(1) Rotate & Glitch function
   - The effects of the wordpad glitch are different when the image is rotated in different ways.
   - I will add an option where you can output four glitches for the one image if a ROTATE variable is activated
   DONE!
(2) Stich and Crop function
   - The wordpad glitch tesselates. That means its a pattern. The effects of the glitch can look much better if the output
   image is stiched together twice and the centre is cropped out of it. Note this only looks good on certain input images and its not
   always a perfect centre crop that will give you a nice image
(3) Filter scan-lines option.
   - Dont like the scanlines so much so there should be a way to filter them out. Desaturation is an option but there is another method which
  - will leave the colors intact which i have somehow managed todo using picassa.
